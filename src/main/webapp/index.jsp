<h2>Hello Basheerah!</h2>

<p>This is my NextWork web application working!</p>

<p>If you see this line in GitHub, that means my latest changes are getting pushed to my cloud repo :o</p>

<p>I am writing this line using nano instead of an IDE.</p>

<p>If you see this line, that means my latest changes are automatically deployed into production by CodePipeline!</p>
